# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

`mon-code-ia` is a personal AI assistant project. The main component is `jarvis/`, a Python-based vocal/text assistant powered by the Claude API.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r jarvis/requirements.txt
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

## Running Jarvis

```bash
# Text mode (terminal only)
python jarvis/jarvis.py

# Voice mode (microphone input + speech synthesis)
python jarvis/jarvis.py --voice
```

## Architecture

`jarvis/jarvis.py` is a single-file application (~100 lines). Key design points:

- **Voice dependency loading** is conditional at module level (not lazy): if `--voice` is in `sys.argv`, `pyttsx3` and `speech_recognition` are imported immediately on startup. This means a missing voice dependency crashes at import time, not at first use.
- **Conversation state** (`_history: list[dict]`) is a module-level global. It accumulates the full turn-by-turn exchange and is passed to every Claude API call, giving multi-turn context. It is lost when the process exits.
- **Model and limits**: hardcoded to `claude-sonnet-4-6` with `max_tokens=1024`.
- **Language**: the system prompt instructs Claude to reply in French by default, switching to the user's language if they write in another one.
- **Exit keywords**: `"quitter"`, `"stop"`, `"exit"`, `"quit"` (checked case-insensitively) terminate the loop.
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is read directly from the environment via `os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"]` — it will raise `KeyError` if unset.
